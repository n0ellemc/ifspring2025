        <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

        <p>Given the last research page of mine, I could perhaps reference the original tollhouse cookie recipe.</p>


        <h4>Invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_chip_cookie">Ruth Graves Wakefield:</a></h4>
        <ul>
            <il>1+1⁄2 cups (350 mL) shortening/butter</il>
            <il>1+1⁄8 cups (265 mL) sugar</il>
            <il>1+1⁄8 cups (265 mL) brown sugar</il>
            <il>3 eggs</il>
            <il>1+1⁄2 teaspoon (7.5 g) salt</il>
            <il>3+1⁄8 cups (750 mL) of flour</il>
            <il>1+1⁄2 teaspoon (7.5 g) hot water</il>
            <il>1+1⁄2 teaspoon (7.5 g) baking soda</il>
            <il>1+1⁄2 teaspoon (7.5 g) vanilla</il>
            <il>chocolate chips (The Tried and True Recipes cookbook specifies "2 bars (7 oz.) Nestlé's yellow label chocolate, semi-sweet, which has been cut in pieces the size of a pea."). (or Cocoa powder, before Chips are added)</il>
        </ul>

        <p>Sourced from Wikipedia.</p>

        <p>Including derivations in the "Common variations" section of the wikipedia could be interesting, as well as links to websites that redirect to those recipes.
        </p>

        <p>I also plan to include an introduction talking about the post-WWII trivia of the Chocolate Chip Cookie like how a lot of websites have intros before getting to recipe, then proceeding to transition with 'here's how you can make them yourself' or such. </p>
