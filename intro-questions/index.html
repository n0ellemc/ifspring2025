            <h3>Q: Who are you?</h3>
            <p>1. My name is Noelle, I am a ComDes senior (my last semester!) </p>
                <br></br>

            <h3>Q: Who really are you?</h3>
            <p>2. I am taking this class for foundations requirements for my major, wanting to refresh
                my CS skills since high school. I suppose that also answers #3. In my Computer Science classes, 
                I also learned some Javascript and am currently learning markdown to create a portfolio website with Hugo.</p>
                <br></br>

            <h3>Q: Why are you here?</h3>
                <p>4. I hope to learn how to use CSS, as I've pretty much all but forgotten the language.
                    I preferred stylizing within the same HTMl file back in the day.
                </p>
                <br></br>

            <h3>Q: Who do you think you are?</h3>
                <p>5. One key difference that I think designing for screen will be distinct from designing from paper
                    is the existence of hidden elements in a linked webpage, that are still very much part of the 'art piece'
                    but elsewhere and not always in the view of the person on the site, even within the same site given having
                    to scroll down.
                </p>

            <h3>Q: Give me something pretty.</h3>
                <p>I quite like this website by Portuguese Mixed Media artist <a href="https://www.heta.moe/">Hetamoe.</a> 
                    I think the aesthetic is very united, despite the design being minimal in the background with white
                    overlaid by icons. As you explore the site, there is a central theme of test printing, anime characters,
                    and philosophy in perzine format.
                </p>

            <h3>Q: Give me something clear.</h3>
                <p>
                    This <a href="https://arboretum.harvard.edu/stories/chionanthus-retusus-the-chinese-fringetree/#:~:text=On%20mature%20trees%2C%20the%20bark,give%20off%20a%20delicate%20fragrance.">
                    Harvard Arboretum site</a> is very pleasant in its structure, strengthening communication through 
                    almost magazine style formatting with sidenotes indented off to the side, variable widths and type 
                    treatments, and a limitation on style to not overwhelm the reader. The line length and font size is 
                    pleasing and not taxing to look at, and the image use to not redundant / each image has a unique purpose.
                </p>
                <br></br>

                <h3>Q: Give me something that just works and makes you go "hell yeah".</h3>
            <p>
                I love this site by typographer Paul Soulellis, it loads very fast and there is a unified style that denotes
                the actionable parts of text (buttons) with an outline versus the non-actionable, static text. From this read,
                one could assume the code of the site is pretty straight forward, but visual interest is not sacrificed because
                of this, which I find impressive.
